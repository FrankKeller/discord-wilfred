# Contributing

Anyone is welcome to contribute and create a pull request at will, however, we will instantly deny any pull request that does not meet these guidelines, we will **not** fix issues for you.
With that said, here's our list of guidelines.

# Standards
- Naming Conventions **must** be consistent with the naming conventions currently being used (`under_score` for methods and 'camelCase' for everything else)    
- No "bodge" code, by this we mean don't want workaround fixes, things should be done the proper way.
- Do not create "Spagetti Code" - i.e. writing so much code that it eventually causes a complete unorganised mess. To keep code clean, use the appropriate comment headers for what you're adjusting or adding if nessary.
- Please try to comment your code so that we can understand what different bits are doing

# Contributing
If you want to contribute please fork the most recent dev branch [not master] and create a pull request as soon as you can, make sure your fork is also kept up to date.
The master branch represents the code which is currently "live" - i.e. it's being run off of the host - the dev branches are the branches in active development

# Discord Rewards
Sometimes we hold events in which you can earn rewards, keep posting in our #server-announcements channel and subscribe to the Wilfred Development Feed

# Testing
Testing of the in-dev branch is ran on a twin server, contributors with the Contributor Rank will be invited to this server to help with testing. The contributor role on the test server will give admin like permissions with the bot, however, everything is runnong off a seperate database and won't affect the live server.

# Collaborators/Staff
Collaborators **should not** commit directly to any branches on this repository unless you're a approved developer (I.e. Matt)
**Do not under any circumstances commit to Master**

# Disclaimer
Having an accepted contribution to the bot does not by any means grant you partial ownership or rights to the bot. In addition approved contributions may be removed at any time by the discretion of the developer.
